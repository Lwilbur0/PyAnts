# PyAnts
gay ant colony simulation

# About
This is a python ant colony that simulates random ant movement that follows or runs from the userâ€™s mouse. I built it to create the most satisfying environment possible.

# Goal and requirements
My goals were to create a collection of entities that travel around the screen and that the user can mess with. The "ants" should move randomly, and react to the user's mouse. I did not aim to make a realistic depiction of an ant colony. The project required understanding of python, pygame, and how to update the movement of the ants.

# Sprint Goal
1. Research traveling salesman problem
2. Understand fundamentals of pygame physics engine
3. Get an ant to follow mouse
4. Simulate path of an ant
5. Simulate path of ant colony as they search for blank item

# Key learnings
I learned how to use pygame to draw objects and initialize a python display. I learned how to create a working button without the use of tkinter. I learned how to use the horizontal and vertical components of velocity to calculate the change in the x and y values of each ant for each frame.

# Running the project
1. Download PyAnts.py file
2. Install pygame using:
   pip install pygame
3. Run the project:
   python3 PyAnts.py
